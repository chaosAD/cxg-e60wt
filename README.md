Video instruction https://youtu.be/t-WOZShN3Fs

A firmware for new soldering irons with STM8S103K3 MCU onboard. Some missing features have been implemented, such as sleep/wake up modes, sounds, errors check, etc. 

For those who wants to re-build the firmware: you'll need two essential pieces of software to work with the STM8:

- stm8flash, a utility for interfacing your ST-Link dongle
* Package: [aur/stm8flash-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stm8flash-git/)
* GitHub: [vdudouyt/stm8flash](https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash)
- SDCC, a compiler
* Package: [community/sdcc](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=sdcc)
* [Home page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdcc/files/snapshot_builds/)

## On Linux:

### To install SDCC
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:laczik/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get remove sdcc sdcc-libraries
sudo apt-get install sdcc
```
### To install stm8flash
```
git clone https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash.git
cd stm8flash
make
sudo make install
```
### To build the firmware
```
git clone https://github.com/pav1388/cxg-e60wt.git
cd cxg-e60wt
make
make flash
```

## Service Menu
You can enter the Service Menu pressing "+" key and Power ON.

Doble-click on any key will cyclically change the following menu items:
* SOU: enable/disable sound, values 0..1 (default 1)
* CAL: calibration value in degrees, range -95..95 (default 0)
* SL1: sleep value in minutes, range 1..30 (default 3)
* SL2: DEEP sleep value in minutes, range 1..60 (default 10)
* FRC: Forced temperature increase range 10..150 (default 40)
* HEA: The voltage of the heating element is 110 or 220 volts (default 110)

To exit the Service Menu just switch OFF/ON the soldering iron

PLEASE NOTE: 
* when in SL1 mode, the soldering iron will keep 100Â°C
* to reset to DEFAULT values press "-" key and power ON the device.

To enter calibration mode pressing "+" and "-" key and Power ON.
